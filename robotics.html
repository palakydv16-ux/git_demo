    <h2>OVERVIEW OF ROBOTICS</h2>
<P>Robotics is the study and application of robots—machines that can perform tasks automatically or with minimal human intervention. It focuses on understanding how robots sense, think, and act in different environments. Robotics covers a wide range of fields like artificial intelligence, electronics, mechanics, and computer programming. </P>

<h2>Modern Robotics</h2>

Modern robotics has rapidly transformed from a niche engineering field into a cornerstone of contemporary technology. Today’s robots operate in homes, hospitals, factories, and even in outer space. This transformation is driven by advances in sensors, computing power, artificial intelligence, and materials science. As these technologies converge, robots are becoming more capable, adaptable, and safe to work alongside humans.

Industrial automation remains one of the most visible applications of robotics. Modern robotic arms can assemble electronics with microscopic precision, weld automotive frames with perfect consistency, and manage logistics at speeds that surpass human capability. Collaborative robots—often called cobots—are designed to work directly with human workers. Equipped with advanced vision and force-sensing systems, they can detect human presence, adjust their movements, and handle tasks that require delicacy rather than brute strength.

In healthcare, robots assist surgeons by providing steady, precise movements that enhance accuracy and reduce risk. Rehabilitation robots help patients regain mobility, while service robots support hospital staff by delivering supplies and cleaning environments. These robotics systems improve patient outcomes and reduce the workload on medical personnel.

Service and personal robotics are also expanding. Household robots vacuum floors, mow lawns, and monitor home security. Social robots provide companionship and assist elderly individuals with daily tasks. As natural-language processing and machine learning advance, these robots are becoming more intuitive and responsive to human needs.

Exploration robotics continues to push boundaries. Autonomous drones map disaster zones and survey agricultural fields, while planetary rovers explore distant worlds. These robots operate in environments too dangerous or inaccessible for humans.

Despite tremendous progress, modern robotics faces challenges, including ethical concerns, job displacement, safety, and the need for trustworthy AI. Addressing these issues responsibly will ensure that robotics continues to enrich society.
